## Simple instruction

This is a fork from: https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper

In order to fetch changes from the original repository, run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:stereolabs/zed-ros2-wrapper.git
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
```

The first command adds the original repository as a remote called `upstream`. The second command restricts pushing to the original repository (so pushes only go to our fork).
